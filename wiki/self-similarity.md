# Self-Similarity

## Definition
[[Self-similarity]] is a property of an object or pattern that exhibits a repeating structure at different scales. In mathematical terms, a set is self-similar if it can be divided into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. This concept is fundamental in the study of [[fractals]], where self-similar patterns are prevalent.

## Mathematical Formalism
A set \( S \) is said to be self-similar if there exists a scaling factor \( r \) such that:

\[
S = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} r S_i
\]

where:
- \( S_i \) are the self-similar subsets of \( S \),
- \( n \) is the number of self-similar pieces.

### Example: Sierpiński Triangle
The [[Sierpiński triangle]] is a classic example of a self-similar fractal. It is constructed by recursively removing the inverted triangle from the center of an equilateral triangle. The self-similarity can be expressed as:

\[
S = \frac{1}{2} S + \frac{1}{2} S + \frac{1}{2} S
\]

where each \( S \) is a scaled-down version of the original triangle.

## Types of Self-Similarity
Self-similarity can be categorized into several types:

### Exact Self-Similarity
In exact self-similarity, the parts are identical to the whole. For example, the [[Cantor set]] is exactly self-similar because each segment removed is a scaled version of the original segment.

### Statistical Self-Similarity
In statistical self-similarity, the parts are not identical but share statistical properties. This is common in natural phenomena, such as coastlines or mountain ranges, where the distribution of features remains consistent across scales.

### Quasi-Self-Similarity
Quasi-self-similarity refers to structures that are approximately self-similar but may not maintain exact proportions or shapes. This can be observed in certain biological structures, such as blood vessels or trees.

## Applications
Self-similarity has applications across various fields:

- **Computer Graphics**: Algorithms for generating textures and landscapes often utilize self-similar patterns to create realistic images.
- **Natural Sciences**: Self-similar structures are observed in biological systems, such as the branching patterns of trees and the structure of lungs.
- **Signal Processing**: Self-similar properties are used in analyzing time series data, particularly in fields like finance and telecommunications.

## Conclusion
Self-similarity is a fundamental concept that underlies many complex structures in mathematics and nature. Its ability to describe patterns that repeat at different scales provides a powerful framework for understanding and modeling a wide range of phenomena.
