# Asymptotic Stability

## Definition
Asymptotic stability refers to a property of an equilibrium point in a dynamical system where the system not only remains close to the equilibrium point when perturbed but also converges to that point over time. Formally, consider a dynamical system described by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):

\[
\dot{x} = f(x)
\]

where \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) and \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \). An equilibrium point \( x^* \) is said to be asymptotically stable if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. **Stability**: For every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that if \( \|x(0) - x^*\| < \delta \), then \( \|x(t) - x^*\| < \epsilon \) for all \( t \geq 0 \).
2. **Attractiveness**: There exists a neighborhood \( U \) of \( x^* \) such that \( \lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = x^* \) for all initial conditions \( x(0) \in U \).

## Mathematical Characterization
To analyze asymptotic stability, one often employs the concept of a [[Lyapunov function]]. A function \( V: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \) is a Lyapunov function for the system if it satisfies:

- **Positive Definiteness**: \( V(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \neq x^* \) and \( V(x^*) = 0 \).
- **Continuity**: \( V(x) \) is continuous in a neighborhood of \( x^* \).
- **Decreasing Condition**: The time derivative along the trajectories of the system, given by \( \dot{V}(x) = \nabla V(x) \cdot f(x) \), satisfies \( \dot{V}(x) < 0 \) for all \( x \) in a neighborhood of \( x^* \).

If such a Lyapunov function exists, then the equilibrium point \( x^* \) is asymptotically stable.

## Examples
1. **Linear System**: Consider the linear system:

\[
\dot{x} = Ax
\]

where \( A \) is a matrix. The equilibrium point \( x^* = 0 \) is asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues of \( A \) have negative real parts. In this case, a suitable Lyapunov function is:

\[
V(x) = x^T P x
\]

where \( P \) is a positive definite matrix satisfying the Lyapunov equation:

\[
A^T P + P A = -Q
\]

for some positive definite matrix \( Q \).

2. **Nonlinear System**: For a nonlinear system such as the simple pendulum described by:

\[
\dot{\theta} = \omega, \quad \dot{\omega} = -\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta)
\]

the equilibrium point \( (\theta, \omega) = (0, 0) \) can be shown to be asymptotically stable using the Lyapunov function:

\[
V(\theta, \omega) = \frac{1}{2} m g L (1 - \cos(\theta)) + \frac{1}{2} m L^2 \omega^2
\]

which represents the total mechanical energy of the system.

## Applications
Asymptotic stability is a crucial concept in various fields, including:
- **Control Theory**: Designing controllers that ensure system stability.
- **Robotics**: Ensuring stable motion and path planning.
- **Economics**: Analyzing the stability of equilibria in economic models.
