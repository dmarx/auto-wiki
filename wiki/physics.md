## Overview
[[Physics]] is the natural science that studies matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature. It seeks to understand the behavior of the universe at both macroscopic and microscopic scales, employing mathematical models and experimental methods to describe physical phenomena.

## Branches of Physics
Physics is broadly divided into several branches, each focusing on different aspects of the physical world:

### Classical Mechanics
Classical mechanics deals with the motion of objects and the forces acting upon them. It is governed by Newton's laws of motion, which can be expressed mathematically as:
1. **First Law (Inertia)**: An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.
2. **Second Law (F=ma)**: The acceleration \( a \) of an object is directly proportional to the net force \( F \) acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass \( m \):
   \[
   F = m a
   \]
3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction)**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### Electromagnetism
Electromagnetism studies electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with charged particles. The fundamental equations governing electromagnetism are known as [[Maxwell's Equations]], which can be summarized as:
1. Gauss's Law for Electricity:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
   \]
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
   \]
3. Faraday's Law of Induction:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   \]
4. Amp√®re-Maxwell Law:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   \]

### Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is the study of heat, work, and energy transfer. It is governed by four fundamental laws:
1. **Zeroth Law**: If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
2. **First Law (Conservation of Energy)**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed:
   \[
   \Delta U = Q - W
   \]
   where \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, \( Q \) is the heat added to the system, and \( W \) is the work done by the system.
3. **Second Law**: The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time.
4. **Third Law**: As the temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero.

### Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. Key principles include:
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Formulated by [[Werner Heisenberg]], it states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision:
  \[
  \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
  \]
  where \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position, \( \Delta p \) is the uncertainty in momentum, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant.

### Relativity
[[Relativity]], developed by [[Albert Einstein]], revolutionized the understanding of space, time, and gravity. The two main theories are:
- **Special Relativity**: Introduces the concept that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion and that the speed of light is constant in a vacuum. The famous equation \( E = mc^2 \) relates energy \( E \) to mass \( m \) and the speed of light \( c \).
- **General Relativity**: Describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. The Einstein field equations relate the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy:
  \[
  G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
  \]
  where \( G_{\mu\nu} \) is the Einstein tensor, \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is the stress-energy tensor, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

## Methodology
Physics employs a systematic approach that includes:
1. **Observation**: Gathering empirical data through experiments and observations.
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Developing theoretical models to explain observed phenomena.
3. **Mathematical Modeling**:
