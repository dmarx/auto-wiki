# Hello World

## Introduction
The phrase "Hello, World!" is a simple program that is often used as a first step in learning a new programming language. It serves as a basic demonstration of the syntax and structure of the language, allowing beginners to understand how to output text to the console or screen.

## Historical Context
The origin of "Hello, World!" can be traced back to the 1970s, specifically to the book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In this context, it was used to illustrate the basic syntax of the C programming language.

## Implementation
The implementation of a "Hello, World!" program varies across different programming languages. Below are examples in several popular languages:

### C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Python
```python
