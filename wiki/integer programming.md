# Integer Programming

## Definition
[[Integer Programming]] (IP) is a mathematical optimization technique where some or all of the decision variables are constrained to take on integer values. It is a subset of [[linear programming]] and is widely used in various fields such as operations research, computer science, and economics for solving problems that require discrete decision-making.

## Mathematical Formulation
An integer programming problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\text{Maximize (or Minimize)} \quad c^T x
\]

subject to:

\[
Ax \leq b
\]

\[
x \in \mathbb{Z}^k \quad \text{(for integer variables)}
\]

\[
x \in \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \quad \text{(for continuous variables)}
\]

where:
- \( c \) is a coefficient vector,
- \( x \) is the vector of decision variables,
- \( A \) is a matrix of coefficients,
- \( b \) is a vector of constraints,
- \( \mathbb{Z}^k \) denotes the set of integer variables, and
- \( \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \) denotes the set of continuous variables.

## Types of Integer Programming
1. **Pure Integer Programming**: All decision variables are required to be integers.
2. **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)**: Some decision variables are integers while others are continuous.
3. **Binary Integer Programming**: Decision variables can only take values of 0 or 1, often used for yes/no decisions.

## Properties
- **NP-Hardness**: Integer programming problems are generally NP-hard, meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve all instances of these problems.
- **Optimality**: The solutions to integer programming problems are often not guaranteed to be optimal due to the discrete nature of the variables, leading to the need for specialized algorithms.

## Solution Methods
1. **Branch and Bound**: A tree-based method that systematically explores the feasible region by dividing it into smaller subproblems and eliminating those that do not satisfy the integer constraints.
2. **Cutting Planes**: This method involves adding additional constraints (cuts) to the linear relaxation of the integer programming problem to eliminate fractional solutions while preserving all integer solutions.
3. **Heuristic Methods**: Approaches such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and local search that provide approximate solutions in a reasonable time frame, especially for large-scale problems.

## Applications
Integer programming is applied in various domains, including:

- **Supply Chain Management**: Optimizing inventory levels, transportation routes, and production schedules.
- **Scheduling**: Assigning resources to tasks while respecting constraints such as time and availability.
- **Finance**: Portfolio optimization where investment decisions are discrete.
- **Telecommunications**: Network design and optimization problems.

## Symbolic Notation
Let \( x \) be the vector of decision variables, \( c \) be the cost vector, \( A \) be the constraint matrix, and \( b \) be the constraint vector. The integer programming problem can be succinctly represented as:

\[
\text{IP:} \quad \max \{ c^T x \mid Ax \leq b, \, x \in \mathbb{Z}^k \}
\]

## Related Concepts
- [[Linear Programming]]: The broader category of optimization problems where decision variables can take any real values.
- [[Combinatorial Optimization]]: A field closely related to integer programming that deals with problems where the objective is to optimize a combinatorial structure.
- [[Dynamic Programming]]: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, often used in conjunction with integer programming techniques.

## Conclusion
Integer programming is a powerful optimization tool that addresses problems requiring discrete decision-making. Its applications span numerous fields, and while it poses computational challenges, various methods exist to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.
