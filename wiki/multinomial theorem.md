# [[Multinomial Theorem]]

## Overview
The [[Multinomial Theorem]] generalizes the binomial theorem to polynomials with more than two terms. It provides a formula for expanding expressions of the form \( (x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k)^n \) into a sum of terms involving products of the variables raised to non-negative integer powers. This theorem is fundamental in combinatorics and has applications in probability, statistics, and algebra.

## Statement of the Theorem
The multinomial theorem states that for any positive integer \( n \) and any non-negative integers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_k \) such that \( k_1 + k_2 + \ldots + k_k = n \), the expansion of \( (x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k)^n \) can be expressed as:

\[
(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k)^n = \sum_{k_1 + k_2 + \ldots + k_k = n} \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \ldots k_k!} x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} \ldots x_k^{k_k}
\]

where:
- \( n! \) is the factorial of \( n \),
- \( k_i! \) is the factorial of \( k_i \),
- The sum is taken over all non-negative integer combinations of \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_k \) that sum to \( n \).

## Example
To illustrate the multinomial theorem, consider the expansion of \( (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^3 \):

\[
(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^3 = \sum_{k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 3} \frac{3!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!} x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} x_3^{k_3}
\]

The possible combinations of \( (k_1, k_2, k_3) \) that satisfy \( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 3 \) include \( (3,0,0), (2,1,0), (1,2,0), (0,3,0), (1,1,1), \) etc. The expansion results in:

\[
= x_1^3 + 3x_1^2x_2 + 3x_1^2x_3 + 3x_1x_2^2 + 3x_1x_3^2 + 3x_2^2x_3 + x_2^3 + x_3^3
\]

## Combinatorial Interpretation
The coefficient \( \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \ldots k_k!} \) represents the number of ways to arrange \( n \) items where \( k_1 \) items are of type \( x_1 \), \( k_2 \) items are of type \( x_2 \), and so on. This combinatorial interpretation is crucial in various applications, such as in probability distributions and statistical mechanics.

## Applications
1. **Probability Theory**: The multinomial theorem is used in the multinomial distribution, which generalizes the binomial distribution to scenarios with more than two outcomes.
2. **Combinatorial Enumeration**: It aids in counting the number of ways to distribute indistinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes.
3. **Algebra**: The theorem is instrumental in polynomial expansions and algebraic manipulations involving multiple variables.

## Conclusion
The multinomial theorem is a powerful tool in combinatorics and algebra, providing a systematic way to expand polynomials with multiple terms. Its applications in probability and combinatorial enumeration highlight its significance in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
