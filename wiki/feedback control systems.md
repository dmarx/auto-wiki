# Feedback Control Systems

## Overview
A [[feedback control system]] is a dynamic system that utilizes feedback to regulate its output. The primary objective is to maintain the desired output despite disturbances or changes in the system's parameters. Feedback control systems are prevalent in engineering, robotics, and various fields of applied mathematics.

## Mathematical Formulation
The behavior of a feedback control system can be described using differential equations. Let \( x(t) \) represent the state of the system at time \( t \), and \( u(t) \) be the control input. The system can be modeled by the following state-space representation:

\[
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)
\]

where:
- \( \dot{x}(t) \) is the derivative of the state vector,
- \( A \) is the system matrix,
- \( B \) is the input matrix.

The output \( y(t) \) can be expressed as:

\[
y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)
\]

where:
- \( C \) is the output matrix,
- \( D \) is the feedforward matrix.

## Feedback Mechanism
In a feedback control system, the control input \( u(t) \) is often a function of the output \( y(t) \) and the desired reference signal \( r(t) \). A common feedback law is the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, defined as:

\[
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
\]

where:
- \( e(t) = r(t) - y(t) \) is the error signal,
- \( K_p \), \( K_i \), and \( K_d \) are the proportional, integral, and derivative gains, respectively.

## Stability Analysis
The stability of feedback control systems is crucial for ensuring that the system responds appropriately to inputs and disturbances. The system is considered stable if all eigenvalues of the matrix \( A - BK \) (where \( K \) is the feedback gain matrix) have negative real parts. This can be analyzed using techniques such as the [[Lyapunov stability theory]] or the [[Routh-Hurwitz criterion]].

## Frequency Domain Analysis
The transfer function \( G(s) \) of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system can be derived from the state-space representation. The transfer function is given by:

\[
G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D
\]

where \( s \) is the complex frequency variable and \( I \) is the identity matrix. The feedback system can be analyzed in the frequency domain using Bode plots, Nyquist plots, and root locus techniques.

## Applications
Feedback control systems are widely used in various applications, including:
- [[Robotics]]: For trajectory tracking and stabilization.
- [[Automotive control systems]]: For cruise control and anti-lock braking systems.
- [[Process control]]: In chemical and manufacturing processes to maintain desired outputs.

## Conclusion
Feedback control systems are essential in modern engineering and applied mathematics, providing robust solutions to dynamic system regulation. Understanding their mathematical foundations and stability criteria is crucial for designing effective control strategies.
