# Free Energy

## Definition
[[Free energy]] is a thermodynamic quantity that measures the amount of work obtainable from a system at constant temperature and pressure. It is a crucial concept in both physics and chemistry, particularly in the study of chemical reactions and phase transitions. The two most commonly used forms of free energy are the [[Gibbs free energy]] and the [[Helmholtz free energy]].

## Mathematical Formulation

### Gibbs Free Energy
The Gibbs free energy \( G \) is defined as:

\[
G = H - TS
\]

where:
- \( H \) is the enthalpy of the system,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin),
- \( S \) is the entropy of the system.

The change in Gibbs free energy \( \Delta G \) during a process is given by:

\[
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
\]

A negative \( \Delta G \) indicates that a process is spontaneous at constant temperature and pressure.

### Helmholtz Free Energy
The Helmholtz free energy \( F \) is defined as:

\[
F = U - TS
\]

where:
- \( U \) is the internal energy of the system.

The change in Helmholtz free energy \( \Delta F \) is given by:

\[
\Delta F = \Delta U - T \Delta S
\]

This form is particularly useful for processes occurring at constant temperature and volume.

## Applications
Free energy concepts are widely applied in various fields:

### 1. Chemical Reactions
In chemical thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy change is used to predict the direction of chemical reactions. A reaction will proceed spontaneously if \( \Delta G < 0 \). The equilibrium constant \( K \) of a reaction is related to the Gibbs free energy change by:

\[
\Delta G = -RT \ln K
\]

where \( R \) is the universal gas constant.

### 2. Phase Transitions
Free energy is also critical in understanding phase transitions, such as melting and boiling. The conditions for phase equilibrium can be derived from the equality of free energies of the phases involved.

### 3. Statistical Mechanics
In statistical mechanics, free energy provides a link between macroscopic thermodynamic properties and microscopic states. The Helmholtz free energy can be expressed in terms of the partition function \( Z \):

\[
F = -k_B T \ln Z
\]

where \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant.

## Conclusion
Free energy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that provides insights into the spontaneity and equilibrium of processes. By quantifying the available work from a system, it serves as a critical tool in various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, physics, and materials science.
