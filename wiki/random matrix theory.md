# Random Matrix Theory

[[Random Matrix Theory]] (RMT) is a field of mathematics and statistical physics that studies the properties of matrices whose entries are random variables. It has applications across various disciplines, including number theory, quantum physics, and machine learning. The central focus of RMT is to understand the statistical behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large random matrices.

## Definition

A random matrix is typically defined as a matrix \( M \) of size \( n \times n \) where the entries \( m_{ij} \) are random variables. The distribution of these entries can vary, leading to different types of random matrices, such as:

1. **Gaussian Random Matrices**: Entries are drawn from a Gaussian (normal) distribution.
2. **Wishart Matrices**: Formed from the product of a random matrix and its transpose.
3. **Bernoulli Random Matrices**: Entries are drawn from a Bernoulli distribution, taking values of 0 or 1.

## Eigenvalue Distribution

One of the primary interests in RMT is the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices. For large \( n \), the eigenvalues of certain classes of random matrices exhibit universal behavior, meaning that their statistical properties do not depend on the specific distribution of the matrix entries.

### Circular Law

For example, the **Circular Law** states that if \( M \) is an \( n \times n \) matrix with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries with zero mean and variance \( 1/n \), then as \( n \to \infty \), the eigenvalues of \( M \) are uniformly distributed on the unit circle in the complex plane.

### Wigner Semicircle Law

Another important result is the **Wigner Semicircle Law**, which describes the limiting distribution of eigenvalues for real symmetric matrices. If \( M \) is a real symmetric matrix with i.i.d. entries, the density of eigenvalues converges to a semicircular distribution:

\[
\rho(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{4 - x^2}, \quad \text{for } |x| \leq 2
\]

## Applications

Random Matrix Theory has a wide range of applications, including:

1. **Quantum Physics**: RMT is used to model the energy levels of complex quantum systems, particularly in nuclear and condensed matter physics.
2. **Number Theory**: Connections between the eigenvalues of random matrices and the distribution of prime numbers have been explored, particularly in the context of the Riemann Hypothesis.
3. **Machine Learning**: RMT is applied in the analysis of high-dimensional data, particularly in understanding the behavior of algorithms in high-dimensional spaces.
4. **Wireless Communications**: RMT is used to analyze the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

## Mathematical Formulations

### Eigenvalue Problem

For a random matrix \( M \), the eigenvalue problem is given by:

\[
M \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue and \( \mathbf{v} \) is the corresponding eigenvector. The characteristic polynomial, which is used to find the eigenvalues, is given by:

\[
P(\lambda) = \det(M - \lambda I) = 0
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

### Stieltjes Transform

The Stieltjes transform is a powerful tool in RMT for analyzing the distribution of eigenvalues. For a measure \( \mu \) associated with the eigenvalue distribution, the Stieltjes transform \( S(z) \) is defined as:

\[
S(z) = \int \frac{1}{x - z} d\mu(x)
\]

This transform can be used to derive the density of eigenvalues and study their asymptotic behavior.

## Conclusion

Random Matrix Theory provides a rich framework for understanding the statistical properties of matrices with random entries. Its universal results and connections to various fields make it a vital area of research in both mathematics and applied sciences.
