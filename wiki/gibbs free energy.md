# Gibbs Free Energy

## Definition
Gibbs Free Energy, denoted as \( G \), is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work obtainable from a closed system at constant temperature and pressure. It is defined mathematically as:

\[
G = H - TS
\]

where:
- \( H \) is the enthalpy of the system,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin),
- \( S \) is the entropy of the system.

## Significance
The change in Gibbs Free Energy (\( \Delta G \)) during a process indicates the spontaneity of that process:
- If \( \Delta G < 0 \): the process is spontaneous.
- If \( \Delta G = 0 \): the system is at equilibrium.
- If \( \Delta G > 0 \): the process is non-spontaneous.

This criterion is crucial in both chemical reactions and phase transitions.

## Relation to Other Thermodynamic Quantities
Gibbs Free Energy is related to other thermodynamic potentials and can be expressed in terms of different variables. For example, in terms of the chemical potential \( \mu \) and the number of moles \( n \):

\[
G = \mu n
\]

Additionally, the differential form of Gibbs Free Energy can be expressed as:

\[
dG = -S dT + V dP + \sum \mu_i dn_i
\]

where:
- \( V \) is the volume,
- \( P \) is the pressure,
- \( \mu_i \) is the chemical potential of component \( i \),
- \( n_i \) is the number of moles of component \( i \).

## Applications
Gibbs Free Energy is widely used in various fields, including:
- **Chemistry**: To predict the direction of chemical reactions and equilibrium positions.
- **Biochemistry**: To understand metabolic pathways and energy changes in biological systems.
- **Materials Science**: To analyze phase diagrams and stability of materials.

## Temperature and Pressure Dependence
The temperature and pressure dependence of Gibbs Free Energy can be analyzed using the following relationships:

1. **Temperature Dependence**:
   The temperature dependence of \( G \) can be derived from the fundamental thermodynamic relation:

   \[
   \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial T} \right)_P = -S
   \]

2. **Pressure Dependence**:
   The pressure dependence is given by:

   \[
   \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial P} \right)_T = V
   \]

## Standard Gibbs Free Energy Change
The standard Gibbs Free Energy change (\( \Delta G^\circ \)) for a reaction at standard conditions (1 bar, 298.15 K) can be calculated using the standard Gibbs Free Energies of formation (\( G_f^\circ \)) of the reactants and products:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \sum G_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \sum G_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

## Conclusion
Gibbs Free Energy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that provides insight into the feasibility and direction of processes in various scientific disciplines. Its mathematical formulation and relationships with other thermodynamic quantities make it a powerful tool for analysis in both theoretical and applied contexts.
