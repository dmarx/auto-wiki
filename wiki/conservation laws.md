# Conservation Laws

## Definition
Conservation laws are fundamental principles in physics and mathematics that state certain physical quantities remain constant within a closed system over time. These laws are essential for understanding the behavior of physical systems and are foundational in various fields, including mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.

## Key Conservation Laws

### 1. **Conservation of Mass**
The law of conservation of mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system. The total mass of a system remains constant over time, regardless of the processes occurring within the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{dM}{dt} = 0
\]

where \( M \) is the total mass of the system.

### 2. **Conservation of Energy**
The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another. The total energy \( E \) can be expressed as:

\[
E = K + U
\]

where \( K \) is the kinetic energy and \( U \) is the potential energy. The conservation of energy can be mathematically represented as:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0
\]

### 3. **Conservation of Momentum**
The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act on it. Momentum \( p \) is defined as the product of mass and velocity:

\[
p = mv
\]

For a system of particles, the total momentum is given by:

\[
P = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i v_i
\]

where \( n \) is the number of particles. The conservation of momentum can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0
\]

### 4. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**
The law of conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external torques act on it. Angular momentum \( L \) is defined as:

\[
L = r \times p = r \times mv
\]

where \( r \) is the position vector from the axis of rotation to the point of application of the force. The conservation of angular momentum can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{dL}{dt} = 0
\]

### 5. **Conservation of Charge**
In electromagnetism, the law of conservation of electric charge states that the total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant over time. This principle is fundamental in understanding electric circuits and electromagnetic interactions. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0
\]

where \( Q \) is the total electric charge.

## Applications
Conservation laws are widely applicable in various fields, including:
- **Physics**: Analyzing collisions, energy transformations, and mechanical systems.
- **Chemistry**: Understanding chemical reactions and stoichiometry.
- **Engineering**: Designing systems that adhere to energy and mass conservation principles.

## Mathematical Formalism
Conservation laws can often be derived from symmetries in physical systems, as described by Noether's theorem. For example, the conservation of energy is associated with time invariance, while the conservation of momentum is related to spatial invariance.

### 1. **Continuity Equation**
In fluid dynamics, the conservation of mass is often expressed using the continuity equation:

\[
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
\]

where \( \rho \) is the fluid density and \( \mathbf{v} \) is the fluid velocity.

### 2. **Energy Conservation in Thermodynamics**
In thermodynamics, the first law of thermodynamics, which is a statement of energy conservation, can be expressed as:

\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]

where \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, \( Q \) is the heat added to the system, and \( W \) is the work done by the system.

## Conclusion
Conservation laws are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of physical systems. They provide critical insights into the dynamics of systems across various scientific disciplines, enabling predictions and analyses of physical phenomena.
