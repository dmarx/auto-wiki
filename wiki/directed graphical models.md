# Directed Graphical Models

## Overview
Directed graphical models, also known as [[Bayesian networks]] or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are a class of probabilistic graphical models that represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed graph. In these models, nodes represent random variables, and directed edges (arrows) indicate the direction of influence or dependency between these variables. Directed graphical models are widely used in various fields, including [[machine learning]], [[statistics]], and [[artificial intelligence]].

## Structure of Directed Graphical Models
A directed graphical model consists of:
- **Nodes**: Each node \( X_i \) represents a random variable.
- **Edges**: A directed edge from node \( X_j \) to node \( X_i \) indicates that \( X_j \) has a direct influence on \( X_i \). This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

\[
P(X_i | \text{Pa}(X_i))
\]

where \( \text{Pa}(X_i) \) denotes the set of parent nodes of \( X_i \).

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
A directed graphical model is acyclic, meaning that it does not contain any directed cycles. This property ensures that there is a clear direction of influence and allows for a consistent interpretation of the dependencies among the variables.

## Joint Probability Distribution
The joint probability distribution of a set of variables represented in a directed graphical model can be expressed using the chain rule of probability:

\[
P(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | \text{Pa}(X_i))
\]

This factorization allows for efficient computation of probabilities and simplifies the representation of complex distributions.

## Inference in Directed Graphical Models
Inference in directed graphical models involves computing the posterior distribution of a subset of variables given evidence about other variables. This can be achieved through various algorithms, including:

1. **Variable Elimination**: A method that systematically eliminates variables from the joint distribution to compute marginal probabilities.
2. **Belief Propagation**: An algorithm that operates on the graph structure to update beliefs about the variables based on observed evidence. It can be applied in two forms:
   - **Message Passing**: Messages are passed between nodes to update beliefs iteratively.
   - **Sum-Product Algorithm**: Used for computing marginal distributions by summing over the joint distribution.

## Learning Parameters and Structure
Learning in directed graphical models can be divided into two main tasks:

1. **Parameter Learning**: Estimating the parameters of the model (e.g., conditional probability tables) from data. This can be done using methods such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or Bayesian estimation.

2. **Structure Learning**: Inferring the structure of the graph itself from data. This involves determining the presence and direction of edges between variables. Common approaches include:
   - **Score-based Methods**: Evaluating different graph structures based on a scoring criterion (e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)).
   - **Constraint-based Methods**: Using statistical tests to determine conditional independence relationships among variables.

## Applications
Directed graphical models have a wide range of applications, including:

- **Medical Diagnosis**: Modeling the relationships between symptoms and diseases.
- **Genetics**: Understanding the interactions between genes and their expressions.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Used in tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and semantic parsing.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Modeling user preferences and item characteristics.

## Conclusion
Directed graphical models provide a powerful framework for representing and reasoning about uncertainty in complex systems. Their ability to model conditional dependencies and perform efficient inference makes them a valuable tool in various scientific and engineering disciplines.
