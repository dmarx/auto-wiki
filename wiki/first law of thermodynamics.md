# First Law of Thermodynamics

The [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] is a fundamental principle in thermodynamics that establishes the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work. It is often expressed in the context of closed systems and is a manifestation of the principle of conservation of energy.

## Mathematical Formulation

The First Law can be mathematically expressed as:

\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]

where:
- \(\Delta U\) is the change in internal energy of the system,
- \(Q\) is the heat added to the system,
- \(W\) is the work done by the system on its surroundings.

### Internal Energy (\(U\))

The internal energy \(U\) of a system is a state function that depends on the microscopic configurations of the system, including the kinetic and potential energies of its particles. For a system with \(N\) particles, the internal energy can be expressed as:

\[
U = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i} + V(x_i) \right)
\]

where:
- \(p_i\) is the momentum of the \(i\)-th particle,
- \(m_i\) is the mass of the \(i\)-th particle,
- \(V(x_i)\) is the potential energy associated with the position \(x_i\) of the \(i\)-th particle.

### Heat Transfer (\(Q\))

Heat transfer \(Q\) can occur through various mechanisms, including conduction, convection, and radiation. The specific heat capacity \(c\) of a substance relates the heat added to the change in temperature:

\[
Q = mc\Delta T
\]

where:
- \(m\) is the mass of the substance,
- \(c\) is the specific heat capacity,
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

### Work Done (\(W\))

Work \(W\) can be defined in various contexts, but in thermodynamics, it is often associated with volume changes in a system. For a system undergoing a quasi-static process, the work done by the system can be expressed as:

\[
W = \int_{V_i}^{V_f} P \, dV
\]

where:
- \(P\) is the pressure of the system,
- \(V_i\) and \(V_f\) are the initial and final volumes, respectively.

## Implications and Applications

The First Law of Thermodynamics has profound implications in various fields, including [[statistical mechanics]], [[chemical thermodynamics]], and [[engineering thermodynamics]]. It serves as a foundational principle for understanding energy transformations in physical and chemical processes.

### Example: Isothermal Process

In an isothermal process (constant temperature), the internal energy change \(\Delta U\) for an ideal gas is zero. Thus, the First Law simplifies to:

\[
Q = W
\]

This indicates that all the heat added to the system is converted into work done by the system.

### Example: Adiabatic Process

In an adiabatic process (no heat exchange), the First Law can be expressed as:

\[
\Delta U = -W
\]

This indicates that the work done on the system results in a decrease in internal energy, leading to a temperature change.

## Conclusion

The First Law of Thermodynamics is a cornerstone of physical science, providing a quantitative framework for analyzing energy interactions in various systems. Its applications extend beyond classical thermodynamics into fields such as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], where energy conservation principles remain pivotal.
