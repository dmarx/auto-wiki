4. Maintain a neutral, objective tone throughout.
5. Format the content using Markdown for readability.
6. Include internal wiki links in [[double brackets]] when referring to other potentially relevant topics.
7. Be comprehensive but concise - focus on the most important information.

9. End with a brief conclusion summarizing the key points.
10. If appropriate, include a "See Also" section with related topics formatted as [[wiki links]].

Your goal is to create a valuable reference article that would fit well in a knowledge wiki.
